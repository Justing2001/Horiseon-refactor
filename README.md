## Description

This challenge tasks me with filtering non-semantic HTML with semantic HTML. For example, div is a command that is simply just a placeholder. So we can swap out div with another command like Header,aside or section to help specify specific pieces of a webpage that is created. After the filtering was complete I re-organized the style.css file to be easily understood and to make sure there was no breaks in my code.
